# dbViewR

dbViewR is an R package that queries the Seattle Flu Study de-identified research database and caches various views of the data for downstream modeling and delivery to the api_service for web visualization.  

RIGHT NOW THIS QUERIES THE SIMULATED DATA.  It's really an exercise for Mike in web-based data queries. 

I suspect this logic should eventually move over to the database itself, but it makes sense to keep it adjacent to model development while we're still figuring out what views we want.
